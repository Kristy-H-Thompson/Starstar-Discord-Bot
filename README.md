# Starstar-Discord-Bot
This project is a commission for a roleplay website, Sinister Haven. Starstar is a custom bot for the website's discord server, and has several coders collaborating to add in new features to the discord bot. The code in this repository is sections that I have worked on.

## Rock, Claw, Leaf
A simple version of rock, paper, sissors, that members are able to play with StarStar

## StarStar talks 
This code allows starstar to answer questions from site members, in the designated starstar channel. Starstar returns the answer as text in the discord channel, but also  by speaking through the speakers of the device similar to a virtual assistant.
